# All you need to know

We are the student Computer Science society at Aston University. We run social and tech events, open to all. You don't need to be studying CS to be a part of the society, nor do you need any technical experience. We're all about learning and sharing ideas!

## Getting involved

1. Become a member by joining the society via [Aston SU](https://www.astonsu.com/society/ComputerScience/). It costs Â£5 for the whole year.

2. [Subscribe to our mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cLia7P) to get regular updates about events and happenings in the society.

3. Like our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/AstonCSS/) and join our [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AstonCSS/), where we post about events and hold member discussions. Check us out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AstonCSS) too!

4. Swing by our society room at the front of Aston Main Building on the 2nd floor. It's open 24 hours to all members!

## Everything else

Each year we run [AstonHack](https://astonhack.co.uk/), our student hackathon. It's a weekend of learning about new technology and building something cool. It's a great place for all levels of skill, and definitely one of our highlights of the year! We also regularly attend other hackathons around the country (and sometimes abroad ðŸŒ´).

Our members really enjoy and benefit from tech talks and workshops from companies and individuals. If you're interested, or you have any other enquiries, please [get in touch](mailto:compsci.society@aston.ac.uk).
