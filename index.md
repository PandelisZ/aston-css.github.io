# Everything you need to know

We are the student Computer Science society at Aston University. We run social
and tech events, open to all. You don't need to be studying CS to be a part of
the society, nor do you need any technical experience. We're all about learning
and sharing knowledge!

## Getting involved

[Aston SU](https://www.astonsu.com/society/ComputerScience/). It costs Â£5 for
the whole year.

2. [Subscribe to our mailing list](#todo) to get regular updates about events and
happenings in the society.
